The library needs to find out some info about a tree to do anything, so
you have to call spr_init() first.

 The functions aren't re-entrant, even though the API is written without
internal state.  A future version could be re-entrant, but this one isn't.
You can have multiple trees being spr()ed at once, just make sure that you
don't have two calls into the library from different threads at the same time.
(esp. to spr_init(), but there might be other functions that aren't safe.)
