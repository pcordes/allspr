 The most up-to-date documentation for the library is the header file,
spr.h.  It is fairly well commented, and of course it lists the available
functions.  The library source code is also well commented, including
comments on what functions are for and how they should be called.  If these
sources are insufficient, email me <peter@cordes.ca>, and tell me what kind
of documentation would be best.  Maybe I'll write some :)

The library needs to find out some info about a tree to do anything, so
you have to call spr_init() first.

 The functions aren't re-entrant, even though the API is written without
internal state.  A future version could be re-entrant, but this one isn't.
You can have multiple trees being spr()ed at once, just make sure that you
don't have two calls into the library from different threads at the same time.
(esp. to spr_init(), but there might be other functions that aren't safe.)

SPRs are done on a rooted tree.  The position of the root will determine which
splits are candidates for SPRs.  This is built in to the SPR algorithm fairly
deeply, so a whole new SPR function would be needed to work with unrooted trees
(or to move the root around).  Some of the supporting library functions could
stay the same, such as the lcg for iterating over all integers from 1-n in a
pseudo-random order.
